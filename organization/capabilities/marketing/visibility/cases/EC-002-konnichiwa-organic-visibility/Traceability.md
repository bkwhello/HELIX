## Lifecycle Traceability

Current stage: Case Establishment / Observation (see Lifecycle Scope.md).

Completed: Case Identity, Purpose, Explicit Boundaries, Observed Conditions, Lifecycle Scope declared. Prior-round Observation and Evidence exist (HV-IV-001–007). One Design realized as Transformation (HV-INT-002, live). One Design blocked before Transformation (HV-INT-001).

Not yet established: new O-001–O-012 formal observation round; any Justified Organizational Claim; Organizational Understanding; Organizational Diagnosis; Evaluation.

No Organizational Design or Transformation beyond the two named interventions is authorized.
